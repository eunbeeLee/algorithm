 *
 * Mark and Jane are very happy after having their first child. Their son loves toys, so Mark wants to buy some.
 * There are a number of different toys lying in front of him, tagged with their prices. Mark has only a certain amount to spend,
 * and he wants to maximize the number of toys he buys with this money.
 *
 * Given a list of prices and an amount to spend, what is the maximum number of toys Mark can buy? For example,
 * if prices = [1,2,3,4] and Mark has k = 7 to spend, he can buy items [1,2,3] for 6, or [3,4] for 7 units of currency. He would choose the first group of 3 items.
